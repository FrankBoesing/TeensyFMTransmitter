/*
   Legal note

  TeensyFMTransmitter is an experimental program, designed only for experimentation.
  It is in no way intended to become a personal media center or a tool to operate a radio station,
  or even broadcast sound to one's own stereo system.

  In most countries, transmitting radio waves without a state-issued licence specific
  to the transmission modalities (frequency, power, bandwidth, etc.) is illegal.

  Therefore, always connect a shielded transmission line from the Teensy directly to a radio receiver,
  so as not to emit radio waves. Never use an antenna.

  Even if you are a licensed amateur radio operator, using TeensyFMTransmitter to transmit
  radio waves on ham frequencies without any filtering between the Teensy and an antenna is most probably illegal
  because the square-wave carrier is very rich in harmonics, so the bandwidth requirements are likely not met.

  I could not be held liable for any misuse of your own Teensy.
  Any experiment is made under your own responsibility.
